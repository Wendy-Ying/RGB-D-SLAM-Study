# RGB-D SLAM Study
The edited version of “一起来做RGB-D SLAM”, can run on ubuntu20.04

I followed the SLAM tutorials “[一起来做RGB-D SLAM](https://www.cnblogs.com/gaoxiang12/p/4633316.html)” in 2023 Summer Vacation, as my first attempt on SLAM.

However, the blog was written in 2015-2016, many libraries have changed till now. I correct those problems, and succesfully run them on my computer, ubuntu20.04.
